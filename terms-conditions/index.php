          <h1 class="h1">Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
          <div class="hr"></div>

<p class="p">Welcome to Fantasy Gems. These Terms & Conditions describe the operation of our service and what you should expect from us, and what we expect from you. When you play with us, you play safely! It is highly recommended to read these terms carefully. They can be read at your own pace. They are written in Plain English, so everything is clear and easy to understand. Fantasy Gems is an entertainment colour prediction game based. We want to be fair, fun and reliable for everyone.</p>

<h2 class="section-title">Understanding These Terms</h2>
<div class="hr"></div>

<p class="p">These Terms and Conditions are applicable to all users who access or use the Fantasy Gems Game. This applies to all activities on the site, including account creation, playing games, or utilising any service on the platform. If you disagree with any of these policies, you should discontinue using Fantasy Gems.</p>

<h2 class="section-title">Eligibility to Use Fantasy Gems</h2>
<div class="hr"></div>

<h2 class="section-title">Age Requirement</h2>
<div class="hr"></div>

<p class="p">Fantasy Gems is for adults only. To register, deposit funds, or play any colour prediction games, you must be at least 18 years old. This regulation ensures minor protection and accountability of the platform. If an account is discovered to be registered to a person under 18, it may be suspended or deleted immediately and without prior notice.</p>

<h2 class="section-title">Legal Access</h2>
<div class="hr"></div>

<p class="p">It is your duty to make sure that online gaming is allowed in your state. You are under no obligation to play Fantasy Gems. By accessing the site, you are doing so legally and of your own free will.</p>

<h2 class="section-title">Account Registration Rules</h2>
<div class="hr"></div>

<p class="p">You must register an account to access all of Fantasy Gems's features. When registering, you must enter accurate and up-to-date information. Providing false information or using someone else's identity is prohibited. Every user has the right to own only one account. Multiple accounts may be restricted or banned permanently. You should keep your login details private. If you share credentials and someone else accesses your account, you’re not punching Fantasy Gems in their account; this undoes their property, and then Fantasy Gems will not be responsible for any loss.</p>

<h2 class="section-title">How Colour Prediction Games Work</h2>
<div class="hr"></div>

<p class="p">Fantasy Gems provides colour prediction games , which are a matter of luck and timing. Every round is a standalone event. Past results have no bearing on what will happen in the future. They are games, by design. Although participants may gain a sense of their own pace or rhythm, there is no way to ensure victory. Losses are wins and wins are losses. Playing calmly and within limits is always advised.</p>

<h2 class="section-title">Deposits and Withdrawals</h2>
<div class="hr"></div>

<p class="p">Deposits When you add funds to your Fantasy Gems wallet, you need to use your own valid payment information. Deposits are typically processed rapidly, but a delay might be caused by technical or banking issues. Deposited amounts are meant for gameplay only and cannot be reversed once used. Withdrawals The processing of withdrawals is subject to the platform rules. You need to do the basic verifications before you can request a withdrawal. Fantasy Gems reserves the right to review requests to ensure fair use and account security. Trying to misuse bonuses or break platform rules can delay or cancel withdrawals.</p>

<h2 class="section-title">Bonuses and Offers</h2>
<div class="hr"></div>

<p class="p">Fantasy Gems may provide bonuses, rewards, or promotional advantages from time to time. These offers are subject to certain terms. The abuse of bonuses, creating fake activity, or gaining an unfair advantage of any kind can result in the revocation of bonuses or penalties to the account. Bonuses are optional. You are free to play without them.</p>

<h2 class="section-title">Fair Play Policy</h2>
<div class="hr"></div>

<p class="p">Fantasy Gems stands for fair play. You are prohibited from any form of system manipulation, the use of bots, or any kind of errors. Accounts identified as participating in unfair activity may be limited, suspended, or terminated. Rulings made in the interest of platform security are final. We’re in it for the long run, not the quick fix.</p>

<h2 class="section-title"><a href="<?php echo $BASE_URL; ?>/responsible-gaming/">Responsible Gaming</a> Reminder</h2>
<div class="hr"></div>

<p class="p">Gaming is always supposed to be light and fun. If gameplay begins to feel too much or you start to get stressed out, it’s fine to stop. Fantasy Gems promotes moderation in everything. Enjoy the game for entertainment and not as a means to solve real-life issues or recover losses. Every player makes their own decisions and is responsible for those decisions. If you'd like to understand more about how we advocate responsible play, you can visit our <a href="<?php echo $BASE_URL; ?>/about-us/">About Us</a> page, which outlines our values.</p>
